## Review

Here's a recap of the tasks you accomplished:

- Enabled CodeQL on your repository.
- CodeQL scanned the code in your repository and notified us of two SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- Reviewed the findings, marked the findings as closed, and explored the audit trail.
- Fixed your code in the main branch and saw that the findings automatically closed out.
- Introduced a new vulnerability in a new branch.
- Created a pull request, and were notified of the vulnerability.

### What's next?

- Continue your learning! Our [code scanning documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/about-code-scanning) is a great resource for learning more about CodeQL.
- Learn more about CodeQL. Take a look at the [CodeQL documentation](https://codeql.github.com/docs/) site to learn about all of the features of this powerful tool.
